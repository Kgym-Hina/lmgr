Welcome to the Logo Manager. Please first read the following information carefully to avoid misuse and possible damage to your device!

<h2 id="1"><img src="img/info.png"> <u><i>1. General Information</i></u></h2>

Logo Manager is an easy-to-use tool for viewing, editing, dumping and flashing the splash screens (logo.img) of certain Xiaomi smartphones.
<p>
It is based on Qt and can therefore be used on various operating systems such as Windows, Linux and MacOS. All necessary files are included, so no installation is required.
	
<h2 id="2"><img src="img/show.png"> <u><i>2. View logos</i></u></h2>

To display the content of a logo.img it can be loaded via "Open".
<p>
Now the contained logos are displayed. Above each logo you can see additional details like resolution, position and size.

<h2 id="3"><img src="img/edit.png"> <u><i>3. Edit logos</i></u></h2>

An original file for the target device must always be used as a basis!
<p>
You can get this e.g. from the firmware file from https://xiaomifirmwareupdater.com/firmware for the desired device.
<p>
Alternatively the logo image can also be read directly from the device with root rights.

<h3 id="3.1"><img src="img/import.png"> <u><i>3.1 Import</i></u></h3>

Via "Import" the respective logo can be replaced by an own one. This logo should have the same size as the original, but will be scaled if necessary.
<p>
After everything has been adjusted the new image can be created via "Save".

<h3 id="3.2"><img src="img/export.png"> <u><i>3.2 Export</i></u></h3>

Via "Export" the respective logo can be extracted. The formats BMP, JPG and PNG are supported.
<p>
The rawdata can also be saved as RAW.

<h2 id="4"><img src="img/dump.png"> <u><i>4. Dump logos</i></u></h2>

With root rights the logo image can be read directly from the device.
<p>
For this Android debugging must be enabled in the developer options.
<p>
If these requirements are met the device can be connected to the PC via USB cable.
<p>
Now the image can be dumped via "Dump" and will be saved under Downloads.

<h2 id="5"><img src="img/flash.png"> <u><i>5. Flash logos</i></u></h2>

Logos can also be installed directly on the device. <font color="red"><b>This is done explicitly at your own risk and can damage your device!</b></font>
<p>
For this the bootloader must be unlocked and Android debugging must be enabled in the developer options.
<p>
If these requirements are met the device can be connected to the PC via USB cable.
<p>
Select the desired image via "Flashing". Afterwards the installation dialog opens and an attempt is made to detect the connected device.
<p>
If this was successful, the device will be restarted in fastboot mode. This takes about 5-10 seconds, so be patient!
<p>
Then the image is installed in the logo partition and the device is rebooted into the system. The new logo should now be displayed.
